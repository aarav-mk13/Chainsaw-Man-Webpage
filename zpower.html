                She's a work partner and good friend with Denji. They share an apartment alongside Aki Hayakawa. 
                She lacks manners and often lies to avoid punishment. She's very fond of her pet cat Nyako to the 
                point she was willing to sacrifice Denji's life to save Nyako who had been captured by a bat demon.
